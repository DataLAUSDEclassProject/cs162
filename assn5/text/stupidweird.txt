almost spill my mug of demon juice.
fall on a random sword and sever my left arm.
have to open a can of whup-butt on your butt.
spend ten minutes gathering the marbles I just dropped all over the place because you bumped into me.
get a gutter ball.
complain about something stupid and weird.
wonder what I'm doing with my life.
get an own goal!
eat a lizard and a snake.
eat brick.
drink lead soup.
break my back by throwing me a frisbee when a dog was standing right behind me.
walk all the way over here after getting beat up.
think you were a good person for a minute there.
almost slip on a banana peel.
spill lentil soup down my pants.
drop my hyperphone into the toilet.
exorcise my guardian demons!
crash out for ten minutes.
knock out from your dumb story.
poop my pants when you smiled.
cry so hard from laughter from looking at you that I kicked this chair into a wormhole by accident.
lose my mind.
slash my Achilles tendon.
actually think life had meaning for a second.
smile for a moment.
eat these 20 pills by mistake.
fall off a cliff.
crash my ship into a cwm.
pee into a bucket of ice.
throw up all over this cantina's floor.
feel so weird that my mind went blank.
slap you.
feel religious for a minute.
feel atheist for a minute.
blow out my gourd.
