A stitch in time saves nine
Like will draw like
In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains
Self-help is the best help
The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend
Slow but steady wins the race
Birds of a feather flock together
Donâ€™t make much ado about nothing
If men had all they wished, they would be often ruined
Pleasure bought with pains, hurts
Look before you leap
Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends
Change of habit cannot alter Nature
Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid
He is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of others
Do not attempt too much at once
Pride goes before destruction
Those who seek to please everybody please nobody
Old friends cannot with impunity be sacrificed for new ones
Little liberties are great offenses
Harm hatch, harm catch
Abstain and enjoy
rekt
Our mere anticipations of life outrun its realities
An ant on the move does more than a dozing ox
Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.
A path is made by walking on it
Happiness is the abscence of the striving for happiness
The wise man knows that it is better to sit on the banks of a remote mountain stream than to be emperor of the whole world
So go but be kind, you have luck on your side, born into a family with food in their bellies, and a car for them to drive. People sleeping on the concrete, still smile behind their signs, So go now be happy and be free, you, you have so much time
The pen is mightier than the sword
No man is an island
